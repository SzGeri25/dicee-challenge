# 🎲 Dicee Game

A simple interactive dice game for two players, inspired by the classic Dicee Challenge. Press the **"Roll"** button to simulate rolling two dice, and see which player wins!

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 Random dice roll for each player  
- 🎞️ Fast rolling animation for visual excitement  
- 🏁 Outcome display showing which player wins (or if it's a draw)  
- 🔁 Easy reset with the "Roll again!" button  


## 🧠 How It Works

- When the **"Roll"** button is clicked:
  1. A rolling animation starts by rapidly switching dice images.
  2. After 2 seconds, the animation stops and two random numbers (1–6) are generated.
  3. The dice images update to show the final result.
  4. The winner is displayed in the heading:
     - **Player 1 Wins**
     - **Player 2 Wins**
     - **Draw**
